									  	<p>Every couple’s big day is different, but typically you can expect to receive 50-90 images per hour of shooting. There are parts of the day where few photos are taken, such as driving and setting up times and parts of the day where I take lots of photos, such as during the ceremony. Each wedding is different, but you will get all the best images from all parts of the day. I remove duplicates and redundant images, and get rid of blinks and blurry photos, and then provide multiple looks from the same moment or pose. Instead of you spending time going through hundreds of pictures to pick your favorites, I do the work for you and leave you only with the very best. Less is more!</p>
